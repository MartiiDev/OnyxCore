# OnyxCore
Core plugin for a Spigot Minecraft server. Its purpose is to centralize lots of plugins to do the same things in the end.

DISCLAIMER: This is my first ever Minecraft plugin so it is probably not stable and probably has some memory leaks!!! Use at your own risks.


## Current features:
- Managing friends
  - You can only add a connected player as friend, it will send a request

  - You can manage your friends with commands or in a GUI


## Planned features:
- Warps, teleports
- Admin/mod tools
